# Lane Detection

This repository is a project about driving lane detection system. Currently, the system relies completely on traditional
computer vision techniques, including but not limited to masking, thresholding, and transformation. In
addition to segmenting driving lane in the original image, the system can also calculate the curve radius of the lane and
the position offset relative to the lane center, which information can be useful for more advanced
topic like self-driving cars.
